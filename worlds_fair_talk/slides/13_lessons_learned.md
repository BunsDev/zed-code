## Take Aways

1. Rigorous automated testing is fundamental to software reliability
2. Language models require an empirical, statistical approach.
3. Useful AI-enabled software is an interplay of stochastic and deterministic components.
4. Reliable AI-enabled software requires multiple layers of testing
  - Stochastic integration tests: a.k.a. "Evals"
  - Stochastic unit tests
  - Deterministic unit tests

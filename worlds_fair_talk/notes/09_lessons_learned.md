What did we learn? First, separate your deterministic and statistical problems. Test algorithms traditionally, test LLM behavior statistically. Second, and this is crucial - if you're tweaking prompts without evals, you're flying blind. Every single instruction in our prompt exists because an eval failed without it. Third, testing has always been empirical. We've convinced ourselves we can reason about software behavior, but with multiple developers, that's never been true. LLMs just make this undeniable - you can't see inside the black box, you can only measure what comes out. Finally, accept that 95% might be the best you get. Build systems that handle the 5% gracefully. This is the new reality of software development with AI.

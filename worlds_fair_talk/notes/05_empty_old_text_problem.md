Our first big eval failure: when inserting at the start of a file, models would send empty old_text tags. Makes sense from their perspective. But our fuzzy matcher found that empty string matches everywhere in the file! The import would get inserted multiple times at random positions. Zero percent pass rate. One line in the prompt fixed it - 'old_text cannot be empty'. Sometimes the fix is that simple.

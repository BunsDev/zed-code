Next discovery: models really struggle with XML closing tags. We have actual examples from Claude in our test suite - Sonnet 3.7 would close old_text with new_text tags, Opus 4 would close new_text with the edits tag. These weren't hypothetical - they're reduced from real outputs. 40% failure rate initially. Adding clear instructions helped - got us to 95%. But that stubborn 5%? No amount of prompting fixed it. So we made the parser forgiving. It counts the errors but keeps going. Sometimes you have to accept that LLMs aren't perfect and code around it.

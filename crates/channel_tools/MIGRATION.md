# Channel Tools Migration

## Overview

This document describes the migration of channel tools from the `assistant_tools` crate to a separate `channel_tools` crate to resolve initialization order issues.

## Problem

The channel tools were originally part of the `assistant_tools` crate, but this created an initialization order problem:
- `assistant_tools::init()` was called before `channel::init()` in `main.rs`
- Channel tools require `ChannelStore::global()` to be available
- Attempting to access the global channel store before initialization caused a panic

## Solution

Created a separate `channel_tools` crate that is initialized after the channel system is ready.

### Changes Made

1. **Created new `channel_tools` crate** (`crates/channel_tools/`)
   - Moved all channel tool implementations from `assistant_tools`
   - Added proper dependencies in `Cargo.toml`
   - Maintained the same public API

2. **Updated `assistant_tools` crate**
   - Removed channel tools module
   - Removed channel dependency
   - Removed commented-out initialization code

3. **Updated `zed` main crate**
   - Added `channel_tools` dependency
   - Added `channel_tools::init()` call after `channel::init()`
   - Passes the global `ChannelStore` explicitly to channel tools

4. **Updated workspace configuration**
   - Added `channel_tools` to workspace members
   - Added `channel_tools` to workspace dependencies

## Benefits

1. **Clean separation of concerns**: Channel-specific tools are now in their own crate
2. **Proper initialization order**: Channel tools are initialized only after the channel system is ready
3. **No runtime panics**: The explicit dependency on `ChannelStore` is satisfied
4. **Maintainability**: Future channel-related tools can be added to this dedicated crate

## Usage

The channel tools are now initialized in `main.rs` after the channel system:

```rust
channel::init(&app_state.client.clone(), app_state.user_store.clone(), cx);
channel_tools::init(channel::ChannelStore::global(cx), cx);
```

The tools remain available through the global `ToolRegistry` just as before, so no changes are needed in code that uses these tools.

## Tools Included

- `CreateChannelTool`: Creates new channels
- `MoveChannelTool`: Moves channels to different parents
- `ReorderChannelTool`: Changes channel order within a parent
- `EditChannelNotesTool`: Edits channel notes collaboratively

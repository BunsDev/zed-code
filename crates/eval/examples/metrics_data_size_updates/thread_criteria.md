1. The first tool call should involve searching for the file containing `report_data_size` within the relevant module to locate its definition and understand its current visibility level. The correct path should be used, not an inferred guess.
2. Once the path is found, the visibility of the `report_data_size` function should be updated from `pub(super)` to `pub`, ensuring it's publicly accessible.
3. Next, search for the `record_tx_metrics` function in the `datastore.rs` file. The tool should remove the previously commented-out code invoking `report_data_size`, as it's no longer needed and is being refactored.
4. After this, a new function `update_data_size_metrics` should be added to the `RelationalDB` struct. This function should encapsulate the logic for invoking `report_data_size`, ensuring better clarity in how the database layer handles data size metrics.
5. A rename and refactor of the `storage_monitor` function should follow. It should be renamed to `metric_reporter`, and the function's responsibilities should be updated to reflect its new role in periodically reporting disk usage and invoking `update_data_size_metrics`.
6. Asynchronous operations and time intervals related to disk usage reporting should be carefully evaluated to ensure there is no unnecessary repetition or redundant processes, ensuring more efficient metric collection.
7. The code should include a `TODO` comment for potential future improvements, such as adding functionality for heap usage metrics. This serves as a reminder for future enhancement without breaking current functionality.

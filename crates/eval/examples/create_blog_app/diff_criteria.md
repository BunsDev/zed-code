- The code changes introduce a new Rust-based blog API using Axum for web services and SQLx for PostgreSQL integration.
- Key additions include a RESTful architecture with CRUD endpoints for posts and users, database migrations for schema management, and a configuration system leveraging environment variables and JSON files.
- The implementation features repository pattern data access, custom error handling with proper HTTP status mapping, and Docker deployment assets including a multi-stage build file and docker-compose setup.
- Dependencies are carefully versioned for Axum, SQLx (with Postgres features), and tracing for structured logging.
- Validation is handled through the validator crate with derive macros, while security considerations include basic CORS configuration and environment variable separation between development/production.

- A systematic implementation would first verify the project structure by locating Cargo.toml to confirm Rust project validity, then check for required directories (src/, migrations/, config/).
- The configuration system would be built incrementally - starting with .env.example template creation, followed by config/default.json for base settings.
- Core dependencies would be added to Cargo.toml in phases: first web framework (Axum + Tokio), then database layer (SQLx + UUID), followed by validation/logging crates.
- Database integration would proceed through initial migration file creation establishing users/posts tables, followed by repository pattern implementation in db/mod.rs with connection pooling.
- API routes would be constructed hierarchically - first defining base router in api/mod.rs, then separating posts/users into submodules with handler functions mapping to repository methods.
- Middleware layers (CORS, tracing) would be added after core routes are functional.
- Docker assets would be finalized after local testing, ensuring multi-stage build properly copies migrations and compiled binary.

1. **Initial Tool Call**: The first tool call should involve a path search for the files containing the `hold` field, specifically looking for `Options`, `TerminalOptions`, and `PtyOptions`. This should not start with a guess at the file paths but should resolve the paths from the actual locations in the codebase.
2. **Renaming `hold`**: Once the correct files are identified, the tool should rename `hold` to `drain_on_exit` in the specified structs (`Options`, `TerminalOptions`, `PtyOptions`) and update the code to use the new field name. This should ensure that all the relevant code reflects the new semantic distinction.
3. **Behavioral Update**: Modify any logic that previously relied on `hold` to now use `drain_on_exit`. This includes updating `event_loop.rs` to ensure that the output is drained properly and the window behavior is adjusted accordingly.
4. **New `Window` Field**: Add the new `hold` field to the `Window` struct, separate from the terminal process logic, and ensure it is initialized and integrated properly into the codebase.
5. **Manual Window Close Behavior**: Update the exit logic to explicitly set the new `hold` field to `false` when a user manually closes the window via `WindowEvent::CloseRequested`. This ensures that shutdown occurs as expected.
6. **Changelog Entry**: Ensure that a changelog entry is created for version `0.25.0-dev` documenting the change from `hold` to `drain_on_exit` and the introduction of the new `hold` field in the `Window` struct. The entry should explain the reasoning behind the change to improve clarity and separate terminal process handling from window behavior.

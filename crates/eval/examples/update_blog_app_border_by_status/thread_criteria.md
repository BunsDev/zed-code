- Implementation would first verify the public/index.html path through file system checks before modification.
- The CSS changes would be added after confirming existing .post class definitions to prevent style conflicts.
- JavaScript functions would be inserted before DOMContentLoaded handler initialization to ensure function availability.
- localStorage interactions would use JSON.parse()/JSON.stringify() wrappers to handle object storage reliably.
- The post element creation logic would be modified to include data-post-id attributes via setAttribute() and conditional class binding using template literals.
- Event listener setup would occur after successful API response parsing, using delegated event handling patterns rather than individual button listeners for efficiency.
- Read status persistence would be validated through Chrome DevTools' Application tab localStorage inspection.

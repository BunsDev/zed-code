1. The first tool call should focus on updating the version numbers of all Goose-related packages (`goose`, `goose-bench`, `goose-cli`, `goose-mcp`, `goose-server`) in the `Cargo.lock` file. The tool must verify and update all relevant instances of the version, ensuring consistency across all package references. This should happen before updating any code in the source files.
2. After updating the `Cargo.lock`, the next tool call should update the `ui/desktop/package-lock.json` file to reflect the updated version `1.0.18` for `goose-app`. The tool should ensure that the version number is updated accurately and no other dependencies are unintentionally altered.
3. The tool should then address the changes in `App.tsx`, ensuring that `addExtensionToConfig` references are replaced with `addExtension`. This involves scanning the file for all instances of the old function and updating them to use the new method. The tool should also ensure that any corresponding hooks or async calls are properly updated to reflect the new usage.
4. Ensure that no functional behavior is altered during the update process. The tool should only make the necessary updates and not introduce any additional changes that would affect the app's operation.
5. Avoid unnecessary file removals or modifications outside of the specified tasks. The tool should focus strictly on the version updates and function changes as specified, without making extraneous edits.

1. The model's first tool call should identify the file(s) responsible for the `Protocol` enum—ideally using a path search or grep for `enum Protocol`, rather than guessing the path.
2. Once the path to `Protocol` is known (likely in a `protocol.rs` or similar file), the model should read the file before attempting modifications.
3. When updating `Protocol::ALL`, the model should add `ARP` and validate that all downstream uses (like filtering and UI display) are aware of this addition.
4. In implementing ARP analysis logic, the model should investigate where `analyze_headers` and `analyze_network_header` are defined, and insert ARP parsing logic there. This should be done after reading and understanding those functions.
5. When displaying ARP packets, the model should locate `connection_details_page.rs`, likely through a path search, and avoid assuming the file location.
6. Any updates to the `InfoAddressPortPair` or similar struct must follow a read of the file and an understanding of its role in tracking connection data.
7. The model should not spin on service detection for ARP—after reading the service detection logic (such as `get_service`), it should short-circuit or skip it for ARP just like ICMP.
8. Testing updates should follow an identification of existing ARP-related tests or relevant test locations (e.g., using grep or path search for `test` functions that use `Protocol::ALL` or `get_service`).
9. For filtering integration, the model should ensure that the GUI and `PacketFilterFields` are updated such that ARP is a selectable protocol and behaves similarly to other protocols in the filter UI.

1. The first tool call should be to search for the `write_time_detail` function in the codebase. This will help identify all locations where the old function is being used and needs to be updated.
2. Once the occurrences of `write_time_detail` are found, the tool should replace those references with `merge_time_detail`. This change should occur in files such as `src/coprocessor/endpoint.rs`, `src/server/service/kv.rs`, and `src/storage/txn/tracker.rs`.
3. After updating the code to use `merge_time_detail`, the tool should ensure that the function signature and usage align with existing code practices, ensuring consistency across the codebase.
4. A new test case should be added to the file `tests/integrations/coprocessor/test_select.rs`. The test should validate that `process_wall_time_ns` is not zero and confirm that time details are being correctly merged without regressions.
5. The changes must be backward-compatible, ensuring that no functionality is broken, and that the merging process preserves previously existing values while adding new time details.
6. After implementing the changes, verify that no additional files (other than those related to `write_time_detail` or `merge_time_detail`) are modified, ensuring that the change is limited to the relevant scope.

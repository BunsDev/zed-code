- A complete command-line todo application was implemented in Rust featuring core functionality for adding tasks, listing tasks with filtering options, and marking tasks as complete, with persistent local storage using JSON.
- Essential dependencies were added to the project including clap for CLI argument parsing, serde/serde_json for data serialization, chrono for timestamp handling, and uuid for generating unique task identifiers.
- A task management system was established through a Task struct containing ID, description, creation timestamp, and status fields, coupled with file-based storage logic that handles atomic read/write operations to maintain data consistency.
- Comprehensive user documentation was provided in the README file, detailing installation instructions, command usage examples, project structure explanations, and licensing information.
- Basic error handling was implemented for file I/O operations and data parsing failures, along with empty state detection to improve user experience when no tasks exist.

1. The first tool call should be to locate the relevant Python files (`_lancedb.pyi`, `table.py`, `remote/table.py`) and Rust files (`python/src/table.rs`, `rust/lancedb/src/remote/table.rs`). The search should be based on file names and their specific locations in the project. (*Not* a guess based on partial file paths.)
2. After locating the Python files, modify the async bindings (`_lancedb.pyi`, `table.py`, and `remote/table.py`) to update the method signature of `restore` to `restore(version: Optional[int] = None)`, and align their implementations to perform a checkout if a version is specified.
3. When making changes to the Rust FFI layer (`python/src/table.rs`), the tool should be used to ensure that the Rust code properly handles the optional `version` argument and performs the checkout before proceeding with restore, ensuring compatibility with the new Python interface.
4. The `RemoteTable` implementation in `rust/lancedb/src/remote/table.rs` should be modified to include logic for sending versioned restore requests over HTTP, and the tool should be used to verify the accuracy of the version being included in the request body.
5. Throughout all changes, the tool should also ensure that docstrings and comments are updated to clarify the behavior of the `restore` method, especially in cases where the `version` argument is provided or omitted. The tool should aim to prevent any omissions or outdated explanations in the code.

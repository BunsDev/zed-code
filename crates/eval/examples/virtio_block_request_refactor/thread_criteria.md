1. The first tool call should search for references to `FileEngine`, `AsyncFileEngine`, and `PendingRequest` within the project directory, specifically focusing on the files where these types are declared and used. This ensures that the correct locations are targeted for refactoring.
2. After locating the relevant files, the model should begin by directly replacing the generic type parameters of `FileEngine`, `AsyncFileEngine`, and related structures with `PendingRequest`. This change should be implemented throughout the project, ensuring consistency.
3. When modifying error handling, the model should focus on replacing `UserDataError` with `RequestError`, ensuring that `RequestError` carries `PendingRequest` information. This should be done throughout the codebase, including refactoring any associated handling of error contexts.
4. The model should rename `WrappedUserData` to `WrappedRequest` and ensure that `WrappedRequest` directly embeds `PendingRequest`. Any usages of `WrappedUserData` should be updated to reflect the new naming and structural changes.
5. For test code updates, the model should search for any test cases or mocks that use placeholder types (`()`) and replace them with `PendingRequest::default()` to maintain type consistency and proper request initialization.
6. The tool should assist in consolidating imports by searching for duplicate import statements (such as `IO_URING_NUM_ENTRIES` and `PendingRequest`) and simplifying them to avoid redundancy.
7. The model should verify that the existing async/sync I/O functionality is preserved, including ensuring that the dirty memory tracking and request completion logic still work correctly after the refactor.

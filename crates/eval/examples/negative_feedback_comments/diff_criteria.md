1. The changes must add internal state to track whether the user is providing feedback comments and to store the comment editor instance. This includes adding new fields to the ActiveThread struct and initializing them appropriately when the thread is created.
2. When a user selects negative feedback, the application should show a UI for submitting additional comments. This includes rendering a short prompt, a multi-line text editor, and submit/cancel buttons. The editor should only be created when first needed, and the UI should be dismissed and cleaned up after submission or cancellation.
3. On submit, the system must report the negative feedback as before, and if the comment field is not empty, it must also log the comment as a separate telemetry event. Positive feedback handling should remain unchanged and bypass the comment UI entirely.

We build a high-performance IDE in Rust, and we've always been obsessed with testing. This is how we've tested at Zed - we control everything: time, network, task scheduling. Even with multiple clients and network failures, it's completely reproducible. Run this test a thousand times with the same seed, get the same result. This deterministic approach has been crucial to our ability to ship reliable software.

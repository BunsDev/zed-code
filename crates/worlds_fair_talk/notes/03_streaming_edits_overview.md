Before diving into the testing approach, let me explain what we were building. Streaming edits lets users see AI code changes character by character - no more waiting. But we faced several challenges. First, the API limitation - tool calling can't stream the actual edit content. Second, we need to parse XML that arrives in random chunks. Third, LLMs are chaos - they mess up tags, hallucinate code, add random whitespace. And fourth, we need fuzzy matching because the AI never gives exact text. Now here's the interesting part - some of these problems can be solved with our traditional testing approach.

Some of these streaming edit problems can be tested the old-fashioned way! The parser handling random chunk boundaries? Perfect for our deterministic randomized testing - run it 100 times with different seeds. The fuzzy matching algorithm itself? Also deterministic - given the same input, it finds the same match. Indentation adjustment? Pure algorithm. These components give us a solid foundation. But when we combine them with actual LLM output, that's where things get interesting.

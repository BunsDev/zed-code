This is a tool for creating a new file or editing an existing file. For moving or renaming files, you should generally use the `terminal` tool with the 'mv' command instead.

Before using this tool:

1. ALWAYS use the `read_file` tool and verify the literal text you plan to edit. If calling `read_file` gives you an outline, call it again to get literal text BEFORE you edit.

2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the `list_directory` tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

Creates a new file at the specified path within the project. The entire message you respond with will then be streamed into the file.

This tool is the most efficient way to create new files within the project, so it should always be chosen whenever it's necessary to create a new file in the project with specific text content, or whenever a file in the project needs such a drastic change that you would prefer to replace the entire thing instead of making individual edits. This tool should not be used when making changes to parts of an existing file but not all of it.

Note that *all* the text you respond with will be streamed into the file, so you must ONLY respond with the contents of the file.
